A Visual Studio - Stackoverflow Exception Assistant

I asked about it years ago: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7816556/visual-studio-extend-ide-the-exception-assistant
I finally got around to starting it. Very much WIP.

NOTE: In order to trap exceptions you MUST turn off the Standard Exception Assistant.
